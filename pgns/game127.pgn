1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 e5 4. Nf3 Nbd7 5. e4 g6 6. Be2 Bg7 7. O-O O-O 8. Be3 Re8 9. d5 Nh5 { Heading to f4 } 10. g3 Bf8 { An interesting maneuver used by many grandmasters. The idea is to drop the knight back to g7 now that the f4 square is covered, and then Black will continue with the thematic f5 break. } 11. Ne1 Ng7 12. Nd3 f5 13. f3 g5 { A straightforward plan to achieve f4. Now White can either allow it, capture on f5 now, or play f4 themselves. } 14. f4 { A risky move, with multiple pawns contesting each other. } 14... exf4 15. gxf4 g4 { Black stands well here, thanks for the added pressure along the e-file. } *
