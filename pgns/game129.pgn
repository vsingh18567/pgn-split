1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 e5 4. Nf3 Nbd7 5. e4 g6 6. Be2 Bg7 7. O-O O-O 8. Be3 Re8 9. d5 Nh5 { Heading to f4 } 10. g3 Bf8 { An interesting maneuver used by many grandmasters. The idea is to drop the knight back to g7 now that the f4 square is covered, and then Black will continue with the thematic f5 break. } 11. Ne1 Ng7 12. Nd3 f5 13. f3 g5 { A straightforward plan to achieve f4. Now White can either allow it, capture on f5 now, or play f4 themselves. } 14. exf5 Nxf5 15. Qd2 h6 16. Ne4 Bg7 17. Rae1 Rf8 { Time for black to develop the rest of the queenside army. If white ever tries to break up the kingside with f4, make sure you exchange your knight for the Be3 first. Will make your life much easier } *
