1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 Bg7 4. Nc3 O-O 5. e4 d6 6. h3 { The Makogonov System with 6. h3 can easily tranpose to similar variations in the study. After all, Kings Indian is more about ideas rather than specific moves. However, I still believe the lines where White goes for g4 and a quick kingside attack deserve some attention } 6... Nbd7 7. Be3 e5 8. d5 Nc5 9. Nd2 a5 10. g4 c6 11. Bxc5 $6 dxc5 { This does ruin BLack's pawn structure a bit, but having the bishop pair in a position that could potentially open up completely is a big plus } 12. Be2 Ne8 13. Qc2 Nd6 14. h4 a4 15. g5 cxd5 16. Nxd5 Be6 17. O-O-O Bxd5 18. exd5 a3 19. b3 f5 *
