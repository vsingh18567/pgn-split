1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. e3 { There will always be those players who play 3. e3, intentionally locking in their dark squared bishop. I will not go into detail on this move except say this is bad. If the London against KID is bad, this is just garbage. } 3... Bg7 4. Be2 O-O 5. O-O d6 6. c4 Nbd7 7. Nc3 e5 { You can see that the plans are basically the same as against the London, except e5 is achieved much easier. No fear. Good luck } *
