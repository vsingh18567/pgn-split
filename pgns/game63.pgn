1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. Bf4 Bg7 4. e3 O-O 5. Be2 d6 6. h3 { The start of the standard London setup by White. My general advice: If you want to beat the London, either 1) Don't play d5. and/or 2) Target the b2 pawn. } 6... Nbd7 7. O-O Qe8 { Preparing the e5 pawn break } 8. c4 { The most demanding move. White starts gaining space before playing Nc3. } 8... e5 9. Bh2 b6 10. Nc3 Bb7 11. Qc2 { Seems like a normal position. However, Black would love to move the Nf6 somewhere in order to play for f5. There are no good squares for it to move. Plus, if the knight ever leaves f6, White can play Nd5, with trouble coming up. } 11... Nh5 12. Nd5 *
