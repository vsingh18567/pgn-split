1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 e5 4. Nf3 Nbd7 5. Bg5 { I face this Bg5 line once in a while. White does not go for e4 or fianchetto but instead goes for a solid setup by getting the bishop out of the pawn chain and then playing e3. Fairly logical, and by no means bad. } 5... h6 6. Bh4 c6 7. e3 g5 8. Bg3 Nh5 { An important move. Otherwise, White will get in h3 and the bishop has a hiding spot on h2. On h5, Black's knight will act as a pest. Nxg3 should be played on one of 2 conditions:
1) White castles kingside. The open h-file will cause White nothing but trouble
