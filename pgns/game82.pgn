1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 e5 { 3. g6 would transpose to a normal King's Indian. However, my recommended move order avoids the sharper Saemisch and 4 Pawns attack. } 4. Nf3 Nbd7 { Here, White has a few more sidelines (d5 and dxe5) and 3 main moves (kingside fianchetto with g3, center control with e4 + Be2, and Bg5). We will analyze all of these in the coming chapters. } *
