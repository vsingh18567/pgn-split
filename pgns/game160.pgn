1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. O-O d6 6. b3 { Double fianchetto is also possible. It tends to leads to quieter positions, but should not be taken lightly! } 6... e5 $1 { You should already be expecting a pawn "sacrifice" like this. Black's Kings Indian bishop wants freedom, and eyes the White rook on a1 at the end of the diagonal! } 7. dxe5 dxe5 8. Qxd8 Rxd8 9. Bb2 e4 10. Ne5 Nbd7 { Nice blockade on e4 of White's light squared bishop } *
