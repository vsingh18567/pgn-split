1. d4 Nf6 2. Bg5 Ne4 3. Bh4 { Bh4 is harmless since it basically gives up the bishop pair. Black can easily capitalize on it by opening up the central dark squares } 3... g5 4. Bg3 Bg7 5. e3 d5 6. Bd3 Nxg3 7. hxg3 c5 8. c3 Qb6 { White will struggle without a dark squared bishop once the position opens up. Black can consider playing e5 next with good prospects. } *
