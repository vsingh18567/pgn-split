1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. Bf4 Bg7 4. e3 O-O 5. Be2 d6 6. h3 { The start of the standard London setup by White. My general advice: If you want to beat the London, either 1) Don't play d5. and/or 2) Target the b2 pawn. } 6... Nbd7 7. O-O Qe8 { Preparing the e5 pawn break } 8. c3 $6 { There are players who blindly follow the London setup no matter what and will play c3 here. Just gladly thank your opponent. c3 gives Black 0 headaches. e5 comes next at ease. } 8... e5 9. Bh2 b6 { One benefit of White playing c3 is that the h1-a8 diagonal is unlikely to get blocked by a white pawn. e4 or d5 is extremely hard to achieve now. } 10. c4 { c4?! can be played but Ne4 just transposes back to the main line and White lost a tempo } 10... Ne4 *
