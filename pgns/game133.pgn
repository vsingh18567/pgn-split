1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 e5 4. Nf3 Nbd7 5. e4 g6 6. Be2 Bg7 7. O-O O-O 8. Re1 exd4 { I have tried many different plans here as Black, such as Re8, c6, a6, b6, and exd4, and from experience, the lines where Black exchanges early with exd4 seem the most clear. Black aims to focus the pressure on the queenside, where he has a pawn majority. } 9. Nxd4 Re8 10. Bf1 a6 11. f3 c6 12. Be3 Ne5 { Preparing b5 by defending the c6 pawn } 13. a4 { Preventing b5 allows a hole on b4. } 13... c5 14. Nc2 Be6 15. b3 Qa5 16. Qd2 Nc6 { With good pressure all around. The kings indian bishop diagonal has opened up and we'll see an intense middlegame battle for sure } *
