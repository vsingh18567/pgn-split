1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. O-O d6 6. c4 Nbd7 7. Nc3 e5 8. e4 { This line combines the kingside fianchetto and e4. My best suggestion is to play on the queenside to take advantage of the White's light squared bishop temporarily off the f1-a6 diagonal. } 8... a6 9. Re1 exd4 10. Nxd4 Re8 11. h3 Rb8 12. Be3 Ne5 13. b3 c5 14. Nde2 b5 { This is the idea of Rb8 earlier. } 15. f4 Ned7 16. Qxd6 { See Wheeler - Bachmann game below for an example of how Black took advantage on White's overextension } *
