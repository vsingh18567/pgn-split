1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 { Notes.
Why is the Najdorf preferred? Because the immediate 5. ... e5 leads to the very strong 6. Bb5+.
Strategic ideas:
-- Pressure on the white e-pawn
-- Black's extra central pawn
-- The Minority attack: the two queenside pawns vs the castled king
-- The exchange sacrifice: give up the rook for the knight on c3 (when W castles queenside) } *
