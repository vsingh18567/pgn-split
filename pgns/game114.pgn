1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 Bg7 4. Nc3 O-O 5. e4 d6 6. h3 { The Makogonov System with 6. h3 can easily tranpose to similar variations in the study. After all, Kings Indian is more about ideas rather than specific moves. However, I still believe the lines where White goes for g4 and a quick kingside attack deserve some attention } 6... Nbd7 7. Be3 e5 8. d5 Nc5 9. Nd2 a5 10. g4 c6 11. Be2 a4 { I recommend a4 here instead of cxd5 as a counterattacking move. Black really doesn't want to force things yet. Instead, you should wait for White to make the first move, such as launch a kingside attack. Then you strike back. } 12. h4 Qa5 { Striking back in the center hard. Now Nxe4 is a threat due to the pin on White's king } 13. g5 $2 Nfxe4 *
