1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. Bg5 Nbd7 { Here there are usually two ways White can continue: either with f3 or Nf3. } 4. f3 { The more dangerous of the two. White prepares e4 next with the full center. I do not recommend a fianchetto here for that reason. } 4... h6 5. Bh4 c5 { It is often the case that an early f-pawn push from your opponent must be punished with a strike in the center. c5 accomplishes that } 6. e3 e6 { And it's hard for White to prove that an early f3 is a pro rather than a con here. Normal development should be fine for Black. Be on the watch for ambitious Qb6 ideas if the position calls for it. } *
