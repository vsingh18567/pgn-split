1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 e5 4. Nf3 Nbd7 5. e4 g6 6. Be2 Bg7 7. O-O O-O 8. Re1 exd4 { I have tried many different plans here as Black, such as Re8, c6, a6, b6, and exd4, and from experience, the lines where Black exchanges early with exd4 seem the most clear. Black aims to focus the pressure on the queenside, where he has a pawn majority. } 9. Nxd4 Re8 10. Bf1 a6 11. f3 c6 12. Be3 Ne5 { Preparing b5 by defending the c6 pawn } 13. Qd2 b5 14. cxb5 axb5 { Pretty standard play. Black has pawns rolling down with b4 and then c5. White's goal is to slowly kick the knight away with f4 after closing off its advancements to either g4 and c4. } *
