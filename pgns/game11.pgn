1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 9. Ne1 Nd7 10. f3 f5 { A thematic pawn storm on the kingside. You will see this often in the Kings Indian, as with this game! } 11. Be3 f4 12. Bf2 g5 13. Nd3 Ng6 14. c5 { It is a race. White's goal is to open up as many lines on the queenside to infiltrate there, while Black is going all out for checkmate. In practice, both sides have around an even score, which is why the Kings Indian is such a popular opening. } 14... Nf6 15. Rc1 Rf7 16. Kh1 h5 17. cxd6 cxd6 18. Nb5 a6 19. Na7 Bd7 { So evidently decides the Knight on a7 will trap itself, so he retreats backwards, but it will come back in the game with Nc4 next. } 0-1
