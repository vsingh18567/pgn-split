1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 { This move does stray away from standard kings indian positions, but playing Bg7 allows e4, and we reach a Pirc, an inferior version of the KID, and not preferable. } 4. e3 Bg7 5. h4 h5 $1 { Black must play h5 here to stop White's h-pawn. 0-0 is a common mistake. } 6. Nf3 O-O 7. Be2 c5 { c5 + Nc6 to immediately contest the center seems to be the most effective. } 8. Ne5 Nc6 9. Qd2 cxd4 10. exd4 Qb6 11. Nxc6 bxc6 { With good pressure on all sides of the board. d4 pawn is a good short term target. } *
