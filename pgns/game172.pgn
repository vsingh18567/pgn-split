1. c4 { Okay, this brings me to the final chapter, and honestly one of the hardest chapters to write. Why? Because I play the English myself as White and I love to face the Kings Indian as white because of the strong Botvinnik attack. White has not committed the knight to f3, so the Botvinnik is still possible. } 1... d6 2. Nc3 g6 { My recommendation here is naturally the one where I have had the most difficulties facing as White. } 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 e5 5. e4 { The start of the Botvinnik setup. Playing Nf6 against it is low-key be asking for trouble. Though I may have a biased opinion because I have had success on the White side. } 5... Nc6 6. Nge2 f5 7. d3 Nf6 8. O-O O-O 9. Nd5 { The best move in this position } 9... Be6 10. Bg5 Qd7 11. Qd2 Rf7 12. f4 fxe4 13. dxe4 Raf8 { Lines where White plays f4 are a bit overextending from experience. Black has no real weaknesses to exploit, so f4 is a bit overextending with space. It may leave permanent pawn weaknesses behind. } *
