You will see this often in the Kings Indian, as with this game! } 11. Be3 f4 12. Bf2 g5 13. Nd3 Ng6 14. c5 { It is a race. White's goal is to open up as many lines on the queenside to infiltrate there, while Black is going all out for checkmate. In practice, both sides have around an even score, which is why the Kings Indian is such a popular opening. } 14... Nf6 15. Rc1 Rf7 16. Kh1 h5 17. cxd6 cxd6 18. Nb5 a6 19. Na3 b5 20. Rc6 g4 21. Qc2 Qf8 22. Rc1 Bd7 23. Rc7 Bh6 24. Be1 h4 { If White has no urgent threat on the queenside, usually Black will just continue pressing on the kingside. } 25. fxg4 f3 26. gxf3 Bxc1 27. Qxc1 { Although this wins the exchange, it was not clear that White's Rc1 was stronger than the Bg5. } 0-1
