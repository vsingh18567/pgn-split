1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 e5 4. Nf3 Nbd7 5. e4 g6 6. Be2 Bg7 7. O-O O-O { This is the starting position of the Be2 line. Here, White has a bunch of tries, but they often lead to similar positions. So I will go over the major lines and share a variety of plans for Black across the next few chapters. This chapter will be dedicated to an immediate d5, the next one will be on Be3, and the third on Re1. } 8. d5 Nc5 9. Qc2 a5 10. Bg5 h6 11. Be3 b6 12. Nd2 Ng4 13. Bxg4 Bxg4 14. a3 Bd7 15. b4 Nb7 { Black cannot prevent b4, but it is still fine. White does get to expand on the queenside, but it is easier to deal with because White doesn't have a light squared bishop anymore. } 16. Nb3 f5 17. f3 f4 18. Bf2 g5 { Pawn race is on! } 19. c5 bxc5 20. bxc5 a4 21. Nd2 Nxc5 22. Bxc5 dxc5 23. Nc4 Ra6 { Rook lift towards the kingside. It is a sharp game from here, but Black's attacking chances are looking good. } *
