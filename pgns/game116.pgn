1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 Bg7 4. Nc3 O-O 5. e4 d6 6. h3 { The Makogonov System with 6. h3 can easily tranpose to similar variations in the study. After all, Kings Indian is more about ideas rather than specific moves. However, I still believe the lines where White goes for g4 and a quick kingside attack deserve some attention } 6... Nbd7 7. Be3 e5 8. d5 Nc5 9. Nd2 a5 10. g4 c6 11. Be2 cxd5 $6 12. cxd5 { I have played cxd5 early before, but this only led to trouble with Nc4 and Bxc5 ideas. It is not fun } 12... Bd7 13. Bxc5 dxc5 14. a4 Ne8 15. Nc4 { White definitely stands better with the invasion of the knights. } *
