1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. Bg5 Nbd7 { Here there are usually two ways White can continue: either with f3 or Nf3. } 4. Nf3 { This line is pretty harmless. White cannot get a pawn center with e4 anytime soon. } 4... g6 5. e3 Bg7 6. Be2 O-O 7. O-O c6 8. h3 b5 { Kind of a dull position here. Around equal. The Nc3 is awkwardly placed, so naturally b5-b4 is a plan to gain space and then hop in to e4. } *
