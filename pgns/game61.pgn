1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. Bf4 Bg7 4. e3 O-O 5. Be2 d6 6. h3 { The start of the standard London setup by White. My general advice: If you want to beat the London, either 1) Don't play d5. and/or 2) Target the b2 pawn. } 6... Nbd7 7. O-O Qe8 { Preparing the e5 pawn break } 8. c4 { The most demanding move. White starts gaining space before playing Nc3. } 8... Ne4 $1 { Ne4 before white can play Nc3 is key. Below is a variation that illustrates why not playing Ne4 can be considered a technical inaccuracy. } 9. Bh2 e5 10. Qc2 f5 *
